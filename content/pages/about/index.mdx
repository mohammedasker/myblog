I'm a Front-End Developer building a beautiful, mobile-responsive, and accessible 
websites and web applications. My interest lies in creating a website that's simple to use and is 
accessible to everyone.

The tools that I've worked with include HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Bootstrap, React.js, and Git. 
I learn these and other technologies regularly and share all the things that I've learnt on this blog.

When I'm away from keyboard, I enjoy reading books, watching anime, and playing video games.
