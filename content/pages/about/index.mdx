I'm a Front-End Developer building a beautiful, mobile-responsive, and accessible 
websites and web applications. My interest lies in creating a website that's simple to use and is 
accessible to everyone.

The tools that I've worked with include HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Bootstrap, React.js, and Git. 
I learn these and other technologies regularly and share all the things that I've learnt on this blog.

I'm available for freelance and if you have new project ideas, you can contact me here [here](/contact).
