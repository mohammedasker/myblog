To check current the Gatsby CLI version, open the terminal and run this command:

```
gatsby -version
```
Alternatively, you can also run this to check current version:
```
gatsby -v
```

At the time of this writing, the current version of Gatsby CLI should be around 3.5.0 and above. If you get `bash: gatsby: command not found` error, make sure that you are in a correct project directory. If you're in a correct path and still getting the same error, chances are you may have not installed Gatsby CLI properly.

In that case, refer to its [official documentation](https://www.gatsbyjs.com/docs/tutorial/part-0/) to see how to install Gatsby CLI on your computer.
